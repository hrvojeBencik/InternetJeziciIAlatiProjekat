      <h1>Jeep Company</h1>
      <p>
        Jeep is a brand of American automobile and division of FCA US LLC
        (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the
        Italian-American corporation Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Jeep has been a
        part of Chrysler since 1987, when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand,
        along with remaining assets, from its previous owner American Motors
        Corporation (AMC). <br />
        <br />
        Jeep's product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles – both
        cross-overs and fully off-road worthy models, including one pickup
        truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as
        small vans, and a few roadsters. Some of Jeep's vehicles—such as the
        Grand Cherokee—reach into the luxury SUV segment, a market segment the
        1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started. Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs
        globally in 2016, up from 500,000 in 2008, two-thirds of which in North
        America, and was Fiat-Chrysler's best selling brand in the U.S. during
        the first half of 2017. In the U.S. alone, over 2400 dealerships hold
        franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles, and if Jeep were spun
        off into a separate company, it is estimated to be worth between $22 and
        $33.5 billion—slightly more than all of FCA (US). <br />
        <br />
        Prior to 1940 the term "jeep" had been used as U.S. Army slang for new
        recruits or vehicles, but the World War II "jeep" that went into
        production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military
        4x4, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production
        vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light
        4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Armed Forces and the Allies
        during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became
        common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart noted: "The
        spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous
        World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky,
        can-do determination." It is the precursor of subsequent generations of
        military light utility vehicles such as the Humvee, and inspired the
        creation of civilian analogs such as the original Series I Land Rover.
        Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have
        since been designed in other nations. <br /><br />
        The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, ever since
        Willys-Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep
        branded models there in 1945. Its replacement, the conceptually
        consistent Jeep Wrangler series, remains in production since 1986. With
        its solid axles and open top, the Wrangler has been called the Jeep
        model that is as central to the brand's identity as the rear-engined 911
        is to Porsche. <br />
        <br />
        At least two Jeep models (the CJ-5 and the SJ Wagoneer) enjoyed
        extraordinary three-decade production runs of a single body generation.
        <br />
        <br />
        In lowercase, the term "jeep" continues to be used as a generic term for
        vehicles inspired by the Jeep that are suitable for use on rough
        terrain.
